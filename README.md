The open-source browser extension of [Colitu VPN](https://colitu.com). It
protects the browser without installing an app: sign in with your Colitu
account, click once, and the browser's traffic leaves through a Colitu server.

## How it works

Browsers can only use HTTP, HTTPS and SOCKS proxies, so the extension does not
run the app transports (VLESS Reality, XHTTP, Hysteria2). Instead:

1. The extension signs in like an app device (`/api/v1/auth/*`,
   `/api/v1/devices/register`, platform `chrome` or `firefox`) or through the
   device link (a code you confirm on colitu.com). Accounts with two-step
   verification (set up on colitu.com) also enter the authenticator-app code
   or a recovery code (`/api/v1/auth/login/mfa`); the short-lived challenge is
   kept in session memory only. Tokens stay in extension storage.
2. It asks the panel for a **proxy ticket** and the server list
   (`POST /api/v1/webproxy/session`). A ticket is a short-lived (≤ 6 h),
   Ed25519-signed statement "this device of this user may use the proxy until
   …". It is refreshed in the background.
3. While connected, the browser talks to an **HTTPS proxy** (TLS, HTTP/2) on
   the chosen node; the ticket is the proxy password. Chrome gets a PAC script
   through `chrome.proxy`; Firefox answers `proxy.onRequest` per request.
   Both use the same routing function ([`src/lib/routing.js`](src/lib/routing.js)).
4. The node verifies tickets offline, counts traffic per device and reports it
   to the panel, which counts it towards the plan (the free plan has 10 GB a
   month) and tells the node to cut off ended plans and removed devices.

The proxy chain has **no `DIRECT` fallback** for websites: if the server
cannot be reached, pages fail instead of leaking around the proxy. Only the
Colitu API itself may fall back to a direct connection, so you can still sign
in and switch servers.

### What goes direct

- the Colitu proxy hosts themselves and local network addresses
  (`localhost`, `10/8`, `172.16/12`, `192.168/16`, `169.254/16`, `100.64/10`,
  `fc00::/7`, `fe80::/10`, `.local`, …);
- the sites on your split-tunneling list (“selected sites bypass the
  proxy”), or every site that is not on it (“only selected sites use the
  proxy”), see below;
- `.ru`, `.su`, `.рф` sites while **Russian sites directly** is on (default,
  as in the apps) and the server is not in Russia.

### Split tunneling

Settings → **Split tunneling**: *Off* (default), *Selected sites bypass the
proxy* or *Only selected sites use the proxy*, with one list of entries:

- a domain matches itself and every subdomain (`example.com` covers
  `www.example.com`; `*.example.com` is read as `example.com`); internationalised
  names are stored in punycode;
- an IPv4 or IPv6 address, or a CIDR range (`203.0.113.0/24`,
  `2001:db8::/32`), matches sites opened by that address. Host names are
  **not** resolved to check address rules: a DNS lookup would happen outside
  the proxy;
- invalid entries are refused with the list of what is wrong; at most 500
  entries.

The rule is part of the same routing function as everything else, so it is
applied the same way in both browsers: in Chrome it is compiled into the PAC
script set through `chrome.proxy.settings` (`DIRECT` for sites that skip the
proxy), in Firefox `proxy.onRequest` returns `{type: "direct"}` for them.
Order of the checks: local addresses and the Colitu proxy hosts (always
direct) → bypass list → Colitu API (proxy with direct fallback) → “only”
list → Russian sites directly → proxy. In “only” mode the user's list wins
over *Russian sites directly*; “only” with an empty list counts as off. The
popup shows “Split tunneling on: N sites” while a list is in effect, and
saving re-applies the proxy setting at once. Settings from 1.0.0 (“all sites /
only these sites” and the two site lists) are carried over.

### WebRTC

While connected (and the setting is on), `privacy.network.webRTCIPHandlingPolicy`
is set to `disable_non_proxied_udp`, so WebRTC cannot reveal the real address.
It is cleared when you disconnect.

## Permissions

| Permission | Why |
|---|---|
| `proxy` | set the browser proxy (Chrome) / answer per-request proxy decisions (Firefox) |
| `<all_urls>` host access | route every site through the proxy, measure server ping, call the Colitu API |
| `webRequest`, `webRequestAuthProvider` (Chrome) | answer the proxy's authentication challenge with the ticket |
| `privacy` | the WebRTC protection |
| `storage` | session tokens, settings and the server list |
| `alarms` | refresh the ticket in the background |

The extension does not read page content, inject scripts into pages, keep a
browsing history or use analytics. See [PRIVACY.md](PRIVACY.md).

## Building

Requires Node.js 20 or newer; there are no npm dependencies.

```
npm test              # routing, PAC, Firefox decisions, translations
npm run build         # dist/chrome, dist/firefox, store zips, SHA256SUMS
```

`node scripts/build.mjs chrome` builds one browser. Zips are reproducible
(fixed timestamps, sorted entries): building the same tag gives the same
SHA-256 as the release. Load `dist/chrome` with *Load unpacked* on
`chrome://extensions` (Developer mode), or `dist/firefox/manifest.json` from
`about:debugging` in Firefox.

`--api=<url>` points a build at another API for local testing; the output goes
to `dist-dev/` and is never published.
